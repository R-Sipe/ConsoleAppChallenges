# Console App Challenges

These challenges are our final project for out gold badge, one is a cafe which allows you to add, remove, view, and create new menu items. The second one is a insurance claim console app which allows you to view all claims, peek the next claim in line, and add a new claim. The third project is a badge system for the employees at the insurance company, allowing you to assign badge numbers and doors to employees, while also removing them and changing them accordingly. Sadly, ran out of time to finish my 04 project so disregard for now, may work on it in the future.
